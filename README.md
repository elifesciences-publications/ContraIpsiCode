Currently the provided code will analyze the neural data in the perturbation epoch.  This included single neuron tuning, timing and population analysis.  Code for the steady-state analysis will be arriving shortly as well as kinematic analysis.
The population analysis utilizes the Manopt tool box found here (https://www.manopt.org/).  If you use this portion of the code please cite the following paper (http://jmlr.org/papers/v15/boumal14a.html)
